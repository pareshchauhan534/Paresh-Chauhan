Hello i  am new and doing a project with INA219 sensor with raspberry pi. I have configured and measured the current voltage and power with single sensor. My doubt is that if i want to measure the voltage and current at different points in circuit so should i connect the new sensor at that point or the previous one would work fine. i need help regarding this.
